This project is a Desktop application to visualize the basic operations behind Elliptic curve cryptography : addition and multiplication in R with an interactive graphical interface, addition and multiplication using the standard curves such as Secp256k1 used in Decryption and Encryption of bitcoin transactions.
In addition to a simulation of ECDH implementation to make the user understand how shared, secret and session keys are generated using ECC basic operations.

This project is made at ENSI as a summer internship project.
